# AssaultCube-Cheat
A extrememly bad assault cube cheat I made for fun while poking around python
Works only for Assault Cube 1.3.0.2 which is the current latest version as of february 2026

# Tutorial!:

First install python from: 
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)](https://python.org/downloads/)

Second and final step! install all the needed packages:
  press the windows key + r then type cmd
  type ```pip install pymem``` then after that installs
  type ```pip install ttkbootstrap``` and when thats done you can finally launch it by typing
  ```python3 Cheats.py``` (It wont open if you don't have assault cube open!)
